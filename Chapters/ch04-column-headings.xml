<summary>So far our toolbar has ignored the main window contents; what if we want it to remain in step with the work area?</summary>

<section>
<p>An alternative to a toolbox at the side of a window, as we <reference id="chap-side-box">created in the last chapter</reference>, is a toolbar across the top of a window. Which to go for is more of a stylistic question than a technical one, and it&rsquo;s possible to have both at the same time. <cite>Ovation&nbsp;Pro</cite> does just this, as seen in <reference id="fig-top-bar-ovation"/>.</p>

<!--image id="fig-top-bar-ovation" file="top-bar-ovation.png" title="Ovation Pro has both a side toolbox and a toolbar at the same time."/ -->

<p>In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll add such a toolbar to our own window, to complement the existing toolbox.</p>
