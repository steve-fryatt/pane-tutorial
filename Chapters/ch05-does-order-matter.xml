<title>Does Order Matter?</title>

<summary>The order in which we open our windows can have some surprising effects &ndash; at least on some systems.</summary>

<section>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve seen how we can manually create one or more panes on our window, and have then behave in a number of distinct ways. Throughout the examples, however, the <function>PROChandle_pane_windows()</function> procedure has always called <swi>Wimp_OpenWindow</swi> for the different windows in a very specific order.</p>

<p>Back in <reference id="sect-side-box-unex"/> we stated that this order was necessary, but hinted that we might be able to simplify things in some circumstances. Now, with all of the main details covered, it seems like a good time to go back and fill in this missing information!</p>
