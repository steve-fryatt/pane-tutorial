Handling Panes
==============

A tutorial on the usage of pane windows under the RISC OS Wimp.


Introduction
------------

Handling Panes is a tutorial about the creation and use of 'pane windows' in multitasking software, within the RISC OS Wimp environment.


Use
---

The tutorial was written with the single purpose of being published on <https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/>, and is consequently in an XML-based format which can be parsed through [XML Docs](https://www.github.com/steve-fryatt/xmldocs) into a format suitable for the home-brew CMS used on that site. The format is largely semantic, however, so with some work on the parser's output module it should be possible to generate output in other formats as well.
