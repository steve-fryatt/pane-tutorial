<p>One area of the RISC&nbsp;OS Wimp which appears to be shrouded in mystery is the handling of pane windows. Whilst many modern applications will have toolbars or status displays, how they&rsquo;'re implemented is something that doesn&rsquo;t seem to get a mention in any of the books on programming.</p>

<p>This guide was written after seeing the question asked many times in the forums and newsgroups. It isn&rsquo;t a beginner&rsquo;s guide to Wimp programming, but a more detauled look at the specific issues surrounding the handling of pane windows within applications. If you&rsquo;re looking for an entry-level guide to the much larger subject of writing desktop applications, I would suggest looking ... here ... </p>

<p>The examples in this tutorial are written in BASIC, but the techniques are equally applicable to other languages such as C &ndash; I hope that I have managed to explain them in a way that allows them to be applied in your environment of choice.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all those on the <link href="https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/">ROOL Forums</link> who have offered suggestions while I&rsquo;ve worked on this guide.</p>
